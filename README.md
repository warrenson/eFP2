# eFP2 Browser
Inspired by [eFP Browser](http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/efp/development/)

Compared to the original eFP browser, eFP2 aims to be more scalable in both data size and diversity. HTML5/JS/CSS frontend, perl backend, SQL(mariaDB) databases. Images are compund SVGs with identifcation and location data embedded within each image element.
